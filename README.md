# DIG-3480-Final
(Original Challenge): 
For my original challenge, I decided to change the amount of robots that needed to be taken down and fixed in order for the game to be more interesting. Instead of having 4 robots in each level, I decided to have 5 robots in the first level and 6 robots in the second level. One of the robots however is vastly more difficult than the others. I didn't want to go overboard with my game, so I decided to keep the changes to a minimum. 

(Visual Changes): 
For my visual changes, I wanted to add the dog sprite from my previous tutorial and add it into the second level for my game. I decided to make the dog an NPC, with a little bit of dialog thrown into the mix. I also wanted to put some more fruit as power ups into my levels, so I added bananas that will increase the players health by at least 2. 

(Audio Change):
My audio changes rarely ever changed throughout my game. I ended up adding 1 or 2 audio clips in the my game, as I already had a lot going on as it is. I didn't want to have to many audio clips and then have it take over the game entirely. The most of the audio that was added was little details, such as health pick up sounds. 

(Gameplay Changes): 
The gameplay changes are the ones that I needed to really work on. I started by adding code to my Dog NPC and adding it to the sprite, then adding a Box Collider and a Rigidbody2D element to it. From there, I also added code to my banana game object so that way the player can be able to have a health increase of 2 instead of 1. I also added a SoundManager code so that way each audio Source and sound are put in their correct spots and not be tangled up everywhere. I believe that these are significant changes because these codes go above and beyond what was originally intended for this project.
